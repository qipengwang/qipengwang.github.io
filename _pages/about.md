I am currently advised by Prof. Gang Huang and Prof. [Xuanzhe Liu](https://liuxuanzhe.com/), and work close with Prof. [Mengwei Xu](https://xumengwei.github.io/index.html). Previously, I received my B.S. in Software Engineer from Beihang University.

My current research mainly focuses on systems for machine learning, especially the edge ML system.
